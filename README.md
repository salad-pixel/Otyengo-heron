# Otyengo (Heron)
The follow-up to Jungle Gym. Explore a uniquely crafted city of birds, known as Otyengo (translates to Heron).

With only your wits and double-jumping player character, the city is all yours for exploring. Perhaps you'd like to listen to records mounted on the wall, marvel at the mechnical cranes, climb the tallest signal tower, wander the many deserted streets littering Otyengo, or learn the story of the birds who once populated the city. What will you find?

Note: This game is STILL under development. **Many** aspects will inevitably be missing. Please keep that in mind! You can build the game yourself in GDevelop by opening the .json file included.
